# CMPINF0010-Project

This is a personal calculator program that can do the four basic calculator functions. It asks you for your name and your inputs, and then politely tells you the output.

This program runs in python. Using it is just a matter of downloading the code and running it with your prefered method of using python. One method of getting this code is with the command:
git clone https://github.com/GBalannik/CMPINF0010-Project.git

When you run the program, it will first query you for your name, which can be any string. Then it asks for 2 inputs, which are both ints. Finaly, the program will ask what opperation you want to perform. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are represented by "+", "-", "*", and "/" respectivly.
